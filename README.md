This repository contains Python Beginner Projects I have worked on

I developed a PyPi Package named explore-data. The package contains a single module that performs exploratory Data Analysis. It has methods that return the number of and list of categorical variables, numerical variables, missing values, outliers as well as methods that also plot out histogram for all numerical variables and bar plot for all categorical variables. This package sits heavily on Python pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn. [LINK HERE](https://github.com/Sumta4real/exploredata) 

Built a simple Quiz game.  The game prints out questions from the list of questions stored in a python list called quiz_bank, reads user input  as answer, evaluates if the answer is correct and then prints out the current score of the player. Repeats this for  all questions and then print the overall score and rank performance of the player. [LINK HERE](https://github.com/Sumta4real/PythonProjects/tree/IntermediateProjects/quiz_project) 

Using the turtle module in Python, I built  a random walk and a spirograph program. LINK HERE
